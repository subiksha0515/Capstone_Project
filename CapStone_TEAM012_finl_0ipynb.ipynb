        "\n",
        "2. **Data and API Setup:**  \n",
        "   - Load FDIC RMS Section 3.2 JSON as the **authoritative regulatory source**.  \n",
        "   - Configure OpenAI API key and endpoint.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Text Normalization & Chunking:**  \n",
        "   - Flatten JSON into text lines.  \n",
        "   - Split into chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.  \n",
        "   - Generate embeddings and store in FAISS for **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **LLM Initialization:**  \n",
        "   - Use `ChatOpenAI` (gpt-4.1-nano) with **temperature 0** for deterministic responses.  \n",
        "\n",
        "5. **OCR Extraction:**  \n",
        "   - Extract loan and credit facts from uploaded images using `pytesseract`.  \n",

        "\n",
        "6. **Regulatory Reasoning Engine:**  \n",
        "   - Retrieve relevant regulatory chunks from FAISS.  \n",
        "   - Use **system prompt** to constrain LLM behavior.  \n",
        "   - Respond with **examiner-aligned observations**, never making credit decisions.  \n",
        "\n",
        "7. **UI / Interaction:**  \n",
        "   - Gradio interface allows:  \n",
        "     - Uploading loan and credit documents.  \n",
        "     - Viewing extracted applicant facts.  \n",
        "     - Chat-based Q&A with regulatory reasoning.  \n",
        "     - FAQ exploration based on Section 3.2 guidance.  \n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Response Governance:**  \n",
        "   - Follow strict formatting rules: bullet points, explicit references, neutral tone.  \n",
        "   - Prevent hallucinations and prohibited terms.  \n",
        "   - Clearly indicate when information is **not stated** in the source documents."
